    "# Currency Conversion with Matrix Multiplication \n",

    "\n",
    "Over the years you have traveled to eight different countries and just happen to have leftover local currency from each of your trips. \n",
    "You are planning to return to one of the eight countries, but you aren't sure which one just yet. \n",
    "You are waiting to find out which will have the cheapest airfare. \n",
    "\n",
    "In preparation, for the trip you *will* want convert *all* your local currency into the currency local of the place you will be traveling to. \n",
    "Therefore, to double check the bank's conversion of your currency, you want to compute the total amount of currency you would expect for each of the eight countries. \n",
    "To compute the conversion you first need to import a matrix that contains the currency conversion rates for each of the eight countries. The data we will be use comes from the [Overview Matrix of Exchange Rates from Bloomberg Cross-Rates _Overall Chart_](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/currencies/cross-rates) on January, 10 2018. "

    "### Coding the Currency Conversion Problem \n",
    "First you will need to create the _**inputs** vector_ that holds the currency you have from the eight countries into a numpy vector. To begin, first import the NumPy package and then use the package to create a vector from a list. Next we convert the vector into a pandas dataframe so that it will print out nicely below with column labels to indicate the country the currency amount is associated to."
